# Careers in Computer Science


## Basics of Software Developer 

#### Software Developer Description

A software developer uses a variety of tools such as source debuggers and visual devleopment environments to help write and reduce bugs in software for client application. Client software is also tested by software developers and they will code applications that will stand by itself or boost the accesbility to servers. 

#### Educational Requirments 

The mimimum requirement for a software developer is to have a bachelors in software development, computer programming, information technology or computer science. Many companies will also want personal experience in the field as well.

#### Techanical Skills 
- Programming language
- Data structure and algorithms,
- IDE’s, databases 
- Text editors 


#### Non-Techanical Skills 
- Problem-solving skills
- Communication
- Accountability time management 

#### Salary


| Salary Range  | Yearly Salary |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Low           | $57 000       |
