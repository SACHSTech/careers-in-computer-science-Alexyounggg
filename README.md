# Careers in Computer Science


## Basics of Software Developer 

#### Software Developer Description

A software developer uses a variety of tools such as source debuggers and visual devleopment environments to help write and reduce bugs in software for client application. Client software is also tested by software developers and they will code applications that will stand by itself or boost the accesbility to servers. 

#### Educational Requirments 

The mimimum requirement for a software developer is to have a bachelors in software development, computer programming, information technology or computer science. Many companies will also want personal experience in the field as well.

## Experiential Learning 

#### Coding Competitions 

One way you can get more experience in the field of software development is by entering coding competitions. One important thing these competitions allow you to do is to try a variety of different coding questions. These will help you improve and get better. You can also try to get to know other people who also want to code as well, helping with non technical skills such as collaboration and communication skills. 

FreeCodeCamp is one of the online competitions that one can join
