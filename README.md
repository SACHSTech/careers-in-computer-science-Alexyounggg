# Careers in Computer Science


## Basics of Software Developer 

#### Software Developer Description

A software developer uses a variety of tools such as source debuggers and visual devleopment environments to help write and reduce bugs in software for client application. Client software is also tested by software developers and they will code applications that will stand by itself or boost the accesbility to servers. 

#### Educational Requirments 

The mimimum requirement for a software developer is to have a bachelors in software development, computer programming, information technology or computer science. Many companies will also want personal experience in the field as well.

#### Techanical Skills 
- Programming language
- Data structure and algorithms,
- IDE’s, databases 
- Text editors 


#### Non-Techanical Skills 
- Problem-solving skills
- Communication
- Accountability time management 

#### Salary


| Salary Range  | Yearly Salary |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Low           | $57 000       | 
| Medium        | $79 000       |  
| High          | $110 000      |   




## Standard Education

#### University

One such university that offers a program that gives you good exposure to software engineering is the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/)

#### Program

One of the programs that they offer is their prestigous computer science program. For Ontario students, the prerequisites for getting into the program are six Grade 12 U and/or M courses including: 

- Advanced Functions
- Calculus and Vectors
- Any Grade 12 U English
- One other 4U course

#### First Year Courses

Semester One:
- CS 135 – Designing Functional Programs
- MATH 135 – Algebra for Honours Mathematics
- MATH 137 – Calculus 1 for Honours Mathematics
- One communication skills course
- One elective

Semester Two: 
- CS 136 – Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction
- CS 136L – Tools and Techniques for Software Development
- MATH 136 – Linear Algebra 1 for Honours Mathematics
- MATH 138 – Calculus 2 for Honours Mathematics
- Two electives

#### Upper Year Courses

- CS 341 – Algorithms
- CS 449 – Human-Computer Interaction or CS 458 – Computer Security and Privacy
- CS 492 – The Social Implications of Computing
- CS 486 – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence


#### Time to Complete Diploma 

It will take roughly 4-5 years to complete the bachelors of computer science at Waterloo.

## Experiential Learning 

#### Coding Competitions 

One way you can get more experience in the field of software development is by entering coding competitions. One important thing these competitions allow you to do is to try a variety of different coding questions. These will help you improve and get better. You can also try to get to know other people who also want to code as well, helping with non technical skills such as collaboration and communication skills. 

FreeCodeCamp is one of the online competitions that one can join
